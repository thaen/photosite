ejirGSd3Hws|Glass Animals - Space Ghost|I loooove Glass Animals. Their track "Life Itself" was one of my favorite a few years ago, earning dozens of plays over the year. This one, I'd never heard. It came on my Amazon Music "My Soundtrack" playlist today and I immediately played it 4 times over.
CPTCrqyf6os|Chromeo - 6 Feet Away|Chromeo released this album last year during deep quarantine and we all needed it so badly.
jWHpIP1-kUI|Alannis Morisette - Reasons I drink|I grew up with Jagged Little Pill as a soundtrack, and to know that Alannis has grown up doing the same things, with the same struggles, is amazing. This song is a belt-alone-in-the-car-at-full-volume kind of track, with all the sensitivity that she's always had.
pAIGuEIkgfE|Mo'Ju - Put it on hold|I don't remember where I heard this track, but it's 100% my jam. I have put it on repeat for an entire day a few times now. It's perfect work music, workout music, anything.
VpAUThB0fJE|Ashnikko - Toxic|Ashnikko was mentioned on the NPR New Music Friday podcast. Her electro-hip-hop album is so over-the-top it's almost embarrassing to listen to, but it's undeniably catchy and I find myself yelling along to the chorus of this track while driving far more often than I should. What's a sheep to a tiger?
DpMfP6qUSBo|Marian Hill - Down|A Peloton coach played a track from Marian Hill during a workout ("Whisky") and I instantly fell in love. I've listened to her album several times in the last few weeks. Reminds me of what I enjoy about Sylvan Esso with an extra singer/songwriter vibe.
jGflUbPQfW8|OMI - Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix)|A billion views on YouTube and I've never heard it. It came on an Amazon Music-generated playlist and I immediately played it three times over.
